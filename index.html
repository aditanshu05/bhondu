        <h1>I’m sorry.</h1>

        <p>
            I hurt you. I raised my voice, disrespected you, and said things
            that should never be said to someone I care about.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no excuse for it. Stress, anger, or an exam do not justify
            how I treated you. I take full responsibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            I understand if you need time. I just want you to know that I am
            genuinely sorry, and I am working on being better.
        </p>
